  -Finally figured out bitshift
  -Another bug, I switched the decoding for offset & flag
  -Found first bug in IP. I am doing the two byte thing wrong. I was
     for ex:,
        uint16_t length = p[4] * 256 + p[5]
	uint16_t id = p[5] *256 + p[6];
     I was overlapping on the numbers.

    -ARP looks fine, but there is still something wrong with IP.
       I can't get any ICMP packets, my flags are always 000 and
       my protocol is always 0. So I am doing something wrong.

    -Got tired of the numbers, started doing indexes on the packet incrementer

    -Have lot of stuff commented out to just work on ARP packets. Will finish
       ARP tomorrow
    -Going to start testing my ARP decode/print. will need to refactor, becuase
    	it looks pretty poorly done.
    -Trying to figure out teh variable length on ARP. It says when it is Ethernet
    	then the value is 6. Does this mean that Hardware address is depdent on hardware
	type? Well when I write it, it seems obvious. But I don't see anywhere in the
	text that explicity says that.
    -Decoding ARP and the IP header. But in those methods I have p[14] and on
        Also I am just decoding and printing on one line. I should seperate this

    -Looks like 5.1a b, c, and d are all totally done. 
    -Printing in hex, also printing the type/length fields
    -Adding debugging symbols to program to see how it works.
    -syntax error when introducing counting packets & displaying
       Ethernet type

   -Changed packettype to packet_type
